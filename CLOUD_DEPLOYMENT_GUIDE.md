# Deploy StockFlow Backend to Cloud

## Option 1: Railway Deployment (Recommended - Free)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code

1. **Create a GitHub Repository** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/min/Desktop/My App/backend"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   # Create a new repo on GitHub and push
   ```

2. **Add environment variables file**:
   Create `railway.env` with:
   ```
   DB_HOST=154.90.45.217
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_NAME=Mindb
   DB_USER=Min
   DB_PASSWORD=Min-591424
   PORT=3001
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

1. **Visit** [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Sign up** with GitHub
3. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select your backend repository**
5. **Add environment variables** in Railway dashboard
6. **Deploy!**

Railway will give you a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Step 3: Update Flutter App

Update your API base URL to use the Railway URL instead of localhost.

## Option 2: DigitalOcean Droplet

### Monthly Cost: ~$6/month
### Better for: Production apps, more control

1. **Create a DigitalOcean account**
2. **Create a $6/month droplet** (1GB RAM, Ubuntu)
3. **Install Node.js and MySQL** on the server
4. **Deploy your code** via Git
5. **Set up PM2** for process management
6. **Configure firewall** and SSL

## Option 3: Use Your Existing Database + Free Backend Hosting

Since you already have a MySQL database on a remote server, you just need to host the Node.js API:

### Free Options:
- **Railway** (recommended)
- **Render** 
- **Vercel** (for serverless functions)
- **Netlify Functions**

## Option 4: Mobile-First Architecture (Advanced)

Redesign your app to work primarily offline with periodic sync:

1. **SQLite on device** for primary storage
2. **Background sync** when internet is available
3. **Cloud database** as backup/sync point
4. **Works offline** completely
